# Installing JsDoc Toolkit #

This is easy. JsDoc Toolkit will run on any computer that can run Java, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.


# Requirements #

  * You must have Java installed in order to run JsDoc Toolkit. Go to the official [Java Download Page](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) to find out how to get Java if you don't already have it.
  * You must download the latest copy of JsDoc Toolkit from [the official download page](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/downloads/list).
  * You _should_ verify that the JsDoc Toolkit zip file you downloaded has not been corrupted or tampered with before unzipping it. The SHA-1 Checksum value for every downloadable file on Google Projects is available on the same page with the download link. To run the check on Windows, use the [sha1sum tool](http://www.labtestproject.com/win/sha1sum.html). The command would look similar to the example below. The long string of characters generated by your sha1sum program should match the signature shown on the google-code download page.

```
C:\Program Files>sha1sum.exe \TEMP\Downloaded\jsdoc_toolkit-1.0.2.zip
b17fc09840eb5e421b1d2c1c99e34f0b99edc9ba  \TEMP\Downloaded\jsdoc_toolkit-1.0.2.zip
```

  * Mac OS X and Linux users can use `openssl` to perform the same task. See this [description of using openssl to verify a SHA-1 digest](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=75510) for more detail.
  * The JsDoc Toolkit [distribution](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/downloads/list) is compressed usingthe [zip archive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_archive) format in order to make it faster to download. You must have a tool for decompressing zip files in order to use JsDoc Toolkit. These are widely available for nearly every platform.

# Installation #

If you have Java and you've unzipped your JsDoc Toolkit download, you're finished! Everything you need to run JsDoc Toolkit is contained in the jsdoc-toolkit folder.

You'll now need to pop open a [command prompt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interpreter) and change your working directory to the jsdoc-toolkit folder. To learn what command line options are available to run JsDoc Toolkit visit the   	CmdlineOptions wiki page.
