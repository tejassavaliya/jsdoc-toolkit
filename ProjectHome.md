JsDoc Toolkit is an application, written in JavaScript, for automatically generating template-formatted, multi-page HTML (or XML, JSON, or any other text-based) documentation from commented JavaScript source code.

Based on the JSDoc.pm project, this was renamed "Jsdoc Toolkit" during development as it grew into more than a simple version upgrade.

**NOTICE: As of 27 June 2010 the JsDoc Toolkit Version 2 project is no longer
under active development or support.**

Please visit the project page for the _latest_ version of JSDoc: [JSDoc 3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc).
